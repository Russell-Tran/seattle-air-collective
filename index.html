                <h3>Electric Stove Utopia</h3>
                <p>Every home in America needs to replace its fossil fuel-burning appliances.</p>
            </aside>
            <aside>
                <h3>Plug The Leak</h3>
                <p>Municipal natural gas lines or abandoned wells. With surgical precision you lobby the cities in America that are leaking the most methane to fix their pipes; save them money. Alternatively, grow the current volunteer community of people who spend their free time tracking down abandoned oil wells to have them plugged and stop leaking methane.</p>

                <h3>Fish Tanks 4 Climate</h3>
                <p>Building a citizen science network of marine aquarium hobbyists who can contribute their tanks to climate change solutions research e.g. seaweed for reduction of cow methane or biofuel</p>

                <h3>Rice Research Network</h3>
                <p>Building a network of rice farms who are willing to volunteer some of their paddies for climate change research, either in methane and nitrous oxide mitigation, or general ecology, plant breeding, etc.</p>
