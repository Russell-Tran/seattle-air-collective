                <h3>Plug The Leak</h3>
                <p>Municipal natural gas lines or abandoned wells. With surgical precision you lobby the cities in America that are leaking the most methane to fix their pipes; save them money. Alternatively, grow the current volunteer community of people who spend their free time tracking down abandoned oil wells to have them plugged and stop leaking methane.</p>
